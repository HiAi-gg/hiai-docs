# Architecture

## Account pipeline cancellation

Server hosts compose `cancelAccountPipelineJobs` from
`@hiai-gg/docsmint/pipeline/cancellation` into the persistent lifecycle
runtime's `cancelAccountJobs` adapter. The supplied `cancelRuns` callback must
run in the actor's request/RLS scope and atomically mark every non-terminal
owned pipeline run `cancelled`. Only BullMQ jobs whose payload contains the
exact matching `ownerId` are removed, and only while waiting, delayed, paused,
or prioritized. Active jobs are never force-removed: prepare/embed adapters
check the durable cancellation fence immediately before each write. Redis
queue namespaces must never be deleted as an account-cancellation shortcut.

The packaged backend composition accepts `{ redisUrl, databaseUrl }`. Each
instance owns its BullMQ handles and postgres-js pool; `close()` releases only
those owned resources, so a new instance can be created safely afterward.

### Module Boundaries & DI Factories

The `backend/src/lib/` directory uses a **factory pattern** so optional public
subpath imports can reuse Redis and SeaweedFS infrastructure without coupling
to DocsMint's `.env` validation:

| File | Purpose | For external use? |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `redis-factory.ts` | Pure `createRedis(cfg: RedisConfig)` — no `config.ts` import | ✅ Yes — `@hiai-gg/docsmint/backend/lib/redis` |
| `storage-factory.ts` | Pure `createStorage(cfg: StorageConfig)` + `ensureBucket()` | ✅ Yes — `@hiai-gg/docsmint/backend/lib/storage` |
| `redis.ts` | Backwards-compatible singleton (calls factory with `config.REDIS_URL`) | Internal only |
| `storage.ts` | Backwards-compatible singletons (`storage`, `storagePublic`) | Internal only |
| `with-tenant.ts` | Thin re-export shim → `packages/db/src/with-tenant` | ✅ Yes — `@hiai-gg/docsmint/db/with-tenant` |
| `metrics.ts` | In-process embedding metrics registry | Internal only |

**npm subpath exports** (see `package.public.json` exports field):

```ts
// RLS-tenant-scoped queries (from shared package)
import { withTenant, adminTenantContext } from "@hiai-gg/docsmint/db/with-tenant";

// Pure factories — no DocsMint config dependency
import { createRedis } from "@hiai-gg/docsmint/backend/lib/redis";
import { createStorage } from "@hiai-gg/docsmint/backend/lib/storage";

// Schema access
import { documents, folders } from "@hiai-gg/docsmint/schema";
```

The RLS context (`with-tenant.ts`) lives in `packages/db/` so the backend and
documented database subpath exports use the same transaction boundary.

## Data Flow

```
User → SvelteKit Frontend → REST API (Elysia) → PostgreSQL
                                              → Redis (queue/cache)
                                               → SeaweedFS (attachments)
                                              → Embedding API or Ollama (graceful fallback)
                                              → Apache AGE (automatic GraphRAG expansion)
```

1. User creates/edits document in TipTap editor
2. Frontend PATCHes document via API
3. API saves content + version to PostgreSQL
4. API enqueues an embedding generation job to Redis
5. Background worker fetches document, chunks text, validates provider vectors, and stages a candidate generation
6. Worker atomically activates a complete finite/non-zero 1024-dimensional generation; failed candidates leave the prior generation active
7. After activation, the worker performs GraphRAG entity extraction into AGE

## Durable BullMQ document pipeline

Document processing is a five-stage BullMQ pipeline backed by PostgreSQL state:

```text
prepare → embed (chunk batches) → graph → summarize → finalize
```

Each stage has its own worker, retry policy, concurrency, and dead-letter
handling. PostgreSQL is the recovery source of truth for the document
generation, revision fence, stage status, batch progress, attempts, errors,
heartbeats, and idempotency. Redis/BullMQ carries executable jobs; it is not the
canonical document store. Queue-state tables never store document bodies or
model output.

Embedding work is split into bounded batches (five chunks by default). A large
document therefore cannot occupy the entire ready queue: only the configured
number of unfinished batches for that document is scheduled at once. A batch
that is already complete is idempotent on retry, and a stale revision is
cancelled before it can activate embeddings.

### Multi-user fairness

Fairness controls limit active work, not submissions. Requests are not rejected
because another owner has many queued documents. Owner-aware leases and
per-document batch windows ensure that one owner or one large document cannot
monopolize workers while other owners make progress. The planned defaults are:

- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_PREPARE_PER_OWNER=2`
- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_EMBED_PER_OWNER=4`
- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_GRAPH_PER_OWNER=1`
- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_BATCHES_PER_DOCUMENT=2`

These controls are separate from provider throttling. Provider limiter modes
are `disabled` (worker concurrency only), `local` (optional GPU-protection
concurrency cap, no API quota), and `remote` (concurrency, requests/minute,
backoff, and `Retry-After` handling).

Search queries run exact/title, language-neutral lexical, fuzzy, and active-generation vector retrieval in parallel. A deterministic confidence gate invokes at most one structured multilingual expansion pass when direct evidence is weak. Authorized AGE graph expansion then contributes related documents. Reciprocal rank fusion combines all channels with exact-title and channel-agreement boosts, finite-score/vector thresholds, and a graph contribution cap. If embeddings, expansion, or AGE are unavailable, the remaining channels still return results.

### Search and embedding invariants

- Every queryable embedding row belongs to `documents.active_embedding_generation`.
- A generation is ready only when every chunk row is valid, finite, non-zero, exactly 1024-dimensional, and profile-consistent.
- A failed or stale candidate never deletes the last active generation.
- Graph extraction runs only after generation activation.
- Query expansion cache keys are tenant-scoped hashes; provider credentials and raw prompts never enter metrics or public responses.
- Graph seed authorization and result hydration use the same owner/public/share visibility scope.

## Module Boundaries

- `api/` imports from `lib/` and `embedding/` — never the reverse
- `embedding/` imports from `lib/` only
- `lib/` has no imports from `api/` or `embedding/`
- `packages/db/` is imported by both backend and has no dependencies on either

## Security Model

- **Data isolation**: personal queries use `ownerId`; trusted external requests
  use the verified opaque `workspaceId` boundary and PostgreSQL RLS
- **Auth**: Better Auth session cookies (7-day expiry)
- **Sharing**: token-based links with optional password + expiry
- **Rate limiting**: 10 req/min per IP on public share endpoints
- **Validation**: Zod schemas on all API inputs
- **No secrets in code**: all config via environment variables

## Integration and authorization boundary

REST is the canonical boundary used by the SDK, CLI, and MCP server. The public
package exposes typed SDK and schema contracts, but integrations must not
bypass owner/category authorization with direct database writes.

Authentication resolves to one principal: Better Auth session, static operator credential, global user API key, or category API key. Global keys receive owner-wide content access. Category keys are restricted to one effective category and an explicit set of `read`, `edit`, and `write` permissions; permissions do not imply each other. Effective category is the document's explicit category or, when absent, the category inherited from folder ancestry. This rule is shared by documents, folders, search, graph, versions, attachments, tags, sharing, and visibility.

API-key issuance, listing, category-secret disclosure, and revocation deliberately bypass the generic Bearer principal resolver and require a Better Auth browser session. Global raw secrets are hash-only and shown once. Category secrets are encrypted at rest so the owning session can recover them. The static operator key is accepted on admin routes through either `x-api-key` or Bearer syntax; an unset operator key fails closed.

DocsMint does not publish outbound document webhooks. The deprecated signed
storage webhook is a no-op compatibility endpoint, not a synchronization
mechanism. Integrations should use REST, SDK, or MCP and query the durable
document pipeline endpoint when they need processing readiness.
