### Module Boundaries & DI Factories

The `backend/src/lib/` directory uses a **factory pattern** that enables external consumers (e.g. `docsmint`) to reuse Redis and SeaweedFS infrastructure **without coupling to hiai-docs' `.env` validation**:

| File | Purpose | For external use? |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| `redis-factory.ts` | Pure `createRedis(cfg: RedisConfig)` — no `config.ts` import | ✅ Yes — `@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/backend/lib/redis` |
| `storage-factory.ts` | Pure `createStorage(cfg: StorageConfig)` + `ensureBucket()` | ✅ Yes — `@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/backend/lib/storage` |
| `redis.ts` | Backwards-compatible singleton (calls factory with `config.REDIS_URL`) | Internal only |
| `storage.ts` | Backwards-compatible singletons (`storage`, `storagePublic`) | Internal only |
| `with-tenant.ts` | Thin re-export shim → `packages/db/src/with-tenant` | ✅ Yes — `@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/db/with-tenant` |
| `metrics.ts` | In-process embedding metrics registry | Internal only |

**npm subpath exports** (see `package.public.json` exports field):

```ts
// RLS-tenant-scoped queries (from shared package)
import { withTenant, adminTenantContext } from "@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/db/with-tenant";

// Pure factories — no hiai-docs config dependency
import { createRedis } from "@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/backend/lib/redis";
import { createStorage } from "@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/backend/lib/storage";

// Schema access
import { documents, folders } from "@hiai-gg/hiai-docs/schema";
```

The RLS tenant context (`with-tenant.ts`) lives in `packages/db/` so it can be shared across both the backend API and any external consumer that imports hiai-docs tables directly.

## Data Flow

```
User → SvelteKit Frontend → REST API (Elysia) → PostgreSQL
                                              → Redis (queue/cache)
                                               → SeaweedFS (attachments)
                                              → Embedding API or Ollama (graceful fallback)
                                              → Apache AGE (automatic GraphRAG expansion)
```

1. User creates/edits document in TipTap editor
2. Frontend PATCHes document via API
3. API saves content + version to PostgreSQL
4. API enqueues an embedding generation job to Redis
5. Background worker fetches document, chunks text, validates provider vectors, and stages a candidate generation
6. Worker atomically activates a complete finite/non-zero 1024-dimensional generation; failed candidates leave the prior generation active
7. After activation, the worker performs GraphRAG entity extraction into AGE

## Durable BullMQ document pipeline

Document processing is a five-stage BullMQ pipeline backed by PostgreSQL state:

```text
prepare → embed (chunk batches) → graph → summarize → finalize
```

Each stage has its own worker, retry policy, concurrency, and dead-letter
handling. PostgreSQL is the recovery source of truth for the document
generation, revision fence, stage status, batch progress, attempts, errors,
heartbeats, and idempotency. Redis/BullMQ carries executable jobs; it is not the
canonical document store. Queue-state tables never store document bodies or
model output.

Embedding work is split into bounded batches (five chunks by default). A large
document therefore cannot occupy the entire ready queue: only the configured
number of unfinished batches for that document is scheduled at once. A batch
that is already complete is idempotent on retry, and a stale revision is
cancelled before it can activate embeddings.

### Multi-user fairness

Fairness controls limit active work, not submissions. Requests are not rejected
because another owner has many queued documents. Owner-aware leases and
per-document batch windows ensure that one owner or one large document cannot
monopolize workers while other owners make progress. The planned defaults are:

- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_PREPARE_PER_OWNER=2`
- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_EMBED_PER_OWNER=4`
- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_GRAPH_PER_OWNER=1`
- `QUEUE_MAX_ACTIVE_BATCHES_PER_DOCUMENT=2`

These controls are separate from provider throttling. Provider limiter modes
are `disabled` (worker concurrency only), `local` (optional GPU-protection
concurrency cap, no API quota), and `remote` (concurrency, requests/minute,
backoff, and `Retry-After` handling).

Search queries run exact/title, language-neutral lexical, fuzzy, and active-generation vector retrieval in parallel. A deterministic confidence gate invokes at most one structured multilingual expansion pass when direct evidence is weak. Authorized AGE graph expansion then contributes related documents. Reciprocal rank fusion combines all channels with exact-title and channel-agreement boosts, finite-score/vector thresholds, and a graph contribution cap. If embeddings, expansion, or AGE are unavailable, the remaining channels still return results.

### Search and embedding invariants

- Every queryable embedding row belongs to `documents.active_embedding_generation`.
- A generation is ready only when every chunk row is valid, finite, non-zero, exactly 1024-dimensional, and profile-consistent.
- A failed or stale candidate never deletes the last active generation.
- Graph extraction runs only after generation activation.
- Query expansion cache keys are tenant-scoped hashes; provider credentials and raw prompts never enter metrics or public responses.
- Graph seed authorization and result hydration use the same owner/public/share visibility scope.

## Module Boundaries

- `api/` imports from `lib/` and `embedding/` — never the reverse
- `embedding/` imports from `lib/` only
- `lib/` has no imports from `api/` or `embedding/`
- `packages/db/` is imported by both backend and has no dependencies on either

## Security Model

- **Data isolation**: every query filters by `ownerId` (user-scoped)
- **Auth**: Better Auth session cookies (7-day expiry)
- **Sharing**: token-based links with optional password + expiry
- **Rate limiting**: 10 req/min per IP on public share endpoints
- **Validation**: Zod schemas on all API inputs
- **No secrets in code**: all config via environment variables
