# HiAi-Docs

**A self-hosted, AI-native knowledge workspace for people, applications, and agents.**

HiAi-Docs stores documents in a structured JSON editor model first. Markdown is
the convenient second format for editing, importing, and exporting content.
Automatic chunking, 1024-dimensional embeddings, multilingual hybrid search,
and GraphRAG make the same knowledge base useful to people, applications, and
agents through the web application, REST API, TypeScript SDK, CLI, and MCP
server.

## Why HiAi-Docs?

- **Write naturally** in a rich visual editor or raw Markdown.
- **Find meaning, not only keywords** with exact, lexical, fuzzy, vector,
  multilingual expansion, and graph retrieval fused through RRF.
- **Keep retrieval current** with automatic, incremental chunking and
  re-embedding after document or metadata changes.
- **Connect agents directly** through REST, a typed SDK, CLI, or MCP.
- **Control access** with global keys or category-scoped `read`, `edit`, and
  `write` permissions.
- **Own the full stack**: application data, vectors, graph, queue, and files run
  on infrastructure you control.

## Fastest installation: give this prompt to your agent

If you are installing HiAi-Docs through an AI coding agent, use this path first.
It keeps the setup to Docker plus one provider choice and avoids unnecessary
source-code changes.

```text
Install HiAi-Docs from https://github.com/HiAi-gg/hiai-docs.
Verify Docker and Docker Compose v2, clone the repository, and run
`bash scripts/quickstart.sh`. Do not print or commit .env. Ask me to enter only
an OpenRouter key or select Ollama, then run quickstart again. Verify
http://localhost:50701, http://localhost:50700/api/health, and
`docker compose ps`. Do not replace Bun, rewrite migrations, disable GraphRAG,
or delete volumes.
```

After startup, open **http://localhost:50701** and create the first account.
For manual installation, use the Docker quickstart below.

## Quickstart

### Requirements

- Docker Engine or Docker Desktop
- Docker Compose v2
- One of:
  - an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) API key; or
  - a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) instance

### Start with Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HiAi-gg/hiai-docs.git
cd hiai-docs
bash scripts/quickstart.sh
```
On its first run, the script creates an ignored root `.env`, generates the
database, authentication, and storage secrets, builds the PostgreSQL image,
applies migrations, and starts the complete application.

For OpenRouter, add one value to `.env` and run the script again:

```dotenv
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-your-key
```
For Ollama, select the local provider instead:

```dotenv
AI_PROVIDER=ollama
OLLAMA_PORT=11434
```
Then make sure the configured local models are available:

```bash
ollama pull bge-m3
ollama pull qwen3:8b
bash scripts/quickstart.sh
```
Open **http://localhost:50701**. The API health endpoint is
**http://localhost:50700/api/health**.

### First use

1. Create your account in the web application.
2. Create a category or folder and add or import a document.
3. Wait for the document pipeline to finish chunking and embedding.
4. Search using an exact phrase, a related concept, an alternate language, or
   a misspelling.
5. Open **Settings → API** when you want to connect a CLI, MCP client, or
   external application.

The canonical local ports are:

| Service | Port |
|---|---:|
| Web application | `50701` |
| REST API | `50700` |
| PostgreSQL | `5437` |
| Redis | `6384` |
| SeaweedFS S3 gateway | `50702` |
| SeaweedFS filer UI | `50703` |

See [Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for domains, TLS, provider tuning,
backups, and production operation.

## Use HiAi-Docs from the terminal

The published package includes the CLI. It connects to an already running
HiAi-Docs server; installing it does not deploy the server.

```bash
bunx --package @hiai-gg/hiai-docs hiai-docs init \
  --url http://localhost:50700 \
  --key 'your-global-or-category-key'

bunx --package @hiai-gg/hiai-docs hiai-docs search "project architecture"
bunx --package @hiai-gg/hiai-docs hiai-docs list
bunx --package @hiai-gg/hiai-docs hiai-docs read <document-id>
bunx --package @hiai-gg/hiai-docs hiai-docs create \
  --title "Release notes" --content "# Version 0.2.8"
```
Credentials can also be supplied through `HIAI_DOCS_URL` and
`HIAI_DOCS_API_KEY`. See the [CLI guide](packages/cli/README.md) for every
command and configuration precedence.

## Connect an MCP client

HiAi-Docs exposes document search, reading, creation, updates, folders,
snapshots, history, and export as MCP tools.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "hiai-docs": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["--package", "@hiai-gg/hiai-docs", "hiai-docs-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "HIAI_DOCS_URL": "http://localhost:50700",
        "HIAI_DOCS_API_KEY": "your-global-or-category-key"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
Run the server directly to verify the installation:

```bash
bunx --package @hiai-gg/hiai-docs hiai-docs-mcp
```
The server uses stdio and works with MCP-capable clients such as Claude
Desktop, Cursor, and coding agents that accept standard MCP configuration. See
the [MCP guide](packages/mcp-server/README.md) for its ten tools and routes.

## Agent skills after installation

The MCP tools are the recommended portable agent skills. A category-bound agent
can receive only the knowledge and operations it needs; a trusted personal
agent can use a global key. Agents do not need database or filesystem access.
After startup, create an API key in **Settings → API** and add the MCP block
above to the agent client. For custom agent workflows, use the same key through
the CLI, SDK, or REST API.

## TypeScript SDK

```bash
bun add @hiai-gg/hiai-docs
```
```ts
import { DocsClient } from "@hiai-gg/hiai-docs";

const docs = new DocsClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:50700",
  apiKey: process.env.HIAI_DOCS_API_KEY,
});

const created = await docs.createDoc({
  title: "Meeting notes",
  content: "# Agenda",
});

const results = await docs.search("what did we decide?");
console.log(created.id, results.items);
```
The SDK is a typed `fetch` client with retries for transient failures. See the
[SDK reference](packages/sdk/README.md) and [REST API](docs/API.md).

## API keys and integrations

Create and revoke integration keys from **Settings → API**.

| Credential | Intended use | Access |
|---|---|---|
| Global API key | Trusted owner-wide CLI, MCP, SDK, or service | All owner content |
| Category key | Least-privilege agent or product integration | One category with selected permissions |
| Operator key | Administration and reindex operations | `/api/admin/*` only |

Category permissions are explicit and non-hierarchical:

- `read` permits list, read, search, and export;
- `edit` permits updates to existing content, attachments, and versions;
- `write` permits create, move, delete, share, and publish operations.

Combine permissions when an integration needs more than one capability.
API-key lifecycle operations require the owning browser session; an API key
cannot create or elevate another key. Server-to-server integrations are not
affected by browser CORS. Browser integrations must add their exact origin to
`CORS_ORIGINS`.

## What is included?

```text
frontend/          SvelteKit workspace and TipTap editor
backend/           Elysia REST API, search, workers, and authentication
packages/db/       Drizzle schema and migrations
packages/sdk/      Typed API client
packages/cli/      Terminal client
packages/mcp-server/  MCP stdio server
postgres/          PostgreSQL image with vector and graph extensions
```
The Docker deployment runs:

- **Web** — document editor, folders, categories, sharing, settings, and search;
- **API** — documents, attachments, versions, keys, search, and administration;
- **PostgreSQL 18** — relational data, pgvector/pgvectorscale vectors, and the
  Apache AGE graph in one database;
- **Redis 8** — BullMQ queues, caching, retries, and job recovery;
- **SeaweedFS** — S3-compatible attachment storage.

## How search works

Every document save schedules background work. Content is chunked, changed
chunks are embedded, and the completed generation is activated atomically. The
previous valid generation remains searchable if a provider call fails.

Search combines exact title matches, multilingual lexical search, typo-tolerant
fuzzy matching, semantic vectors, adaptive query expansion, and Apache AGE
graph neighbors. Reciprocal rank fusion combines the channels without allowing
one weak provider result to dominate. Authorization is applied before retrieval
and again before results are returned.

GraphRAG is part of the normal search path in the reference configuration. It
extracts entities after embeddings are ready and finds related documents beyond
direct keyword or vector similarity. It degrades gracefully when an external
model is unavailable.

For pipeline internals and tuning, see [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[Deployment](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Stack

## Comparison

HiAi-Docs overlaps with several excellent open-source knowledge tools, but its
focus is a compact knowledge runtime shared equally by humans and agents.

| Project | Primary strength | Difference from HiAi-Docs |
|---|---|---|
| [Outline](https://github.com/outline/outline) | Polished team wiki and collaboration | HiAi-Docs emphasizes built-in retrieval, GraphRAG, scoped agent access, CLI, and MCP |
| [Docmost](https://github.com/docmost/docmost) | Collaborative wiki and real-time editing | HiAi-Docs centers automatic embeddings and agent-facing integration surfaces |
| [AppFlowy](https://github.com/AppFlowy-IO/AppFlowy) | Broad local-first productivity workspace | HiAi-Docs is narrower: a self-hosted document and retrieval service |
| [AnythingLLM](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm) | Chat-oriented RAG over imported sources | HiAi-Docs starts with the editable knowledge base and exposes it to many clients |
| [Danswer](https://github.com/danswer-ai/danswer) / Onyx | Enterprise search across external connectors | HiAi-Docs owns and edits its native corpus rather than primarily indexing other systems |

This is a product-positioning summary, not a claim that every listed project
lacks a feature. Check each project's current documentation when choosing a
