-- Installs the four extensions we need. Graph objects, labels, graph indexes,

-- migrations (packages/db/src/migrations). This file is intentionally
-- extension-only: it MUST NOT create graph objects, labels, graph indexes, or
-- grant GraphRAG object privileges.

-- Vector search + StreamingDiskANN (pgvectorscale requires pgvector).

-- CREATE EXTENSION installs the SQL definitions but does NOT load the

-- cypher(cstring) function call" because AGE's parser/planner hooks
-- are never registered. This must be a database-level setting (not
-- session-local) so it applies to every connection in the pool.

-- is kept second so that AGE's `agtype`/`graphid_ops` still resolve
-- without the schema prefix. The session-local `SET search_path`
-- above only affects the current docker-entrypoint-initdb.d session;
-- this ALTER ROLE persists across the connection pool.
